create function to recursively create directories
write test functions
write test programs
store temporary err_num value when recoverable so it is not overwritten
alter makefile to produce files from .in
disable IPC_CREAT and IPC_EXCL elsewhere
make ipc_t not fail spectacularly in ipc_t_set() when the path is not set and it tries to make a key, but rather make a new error for this situation
create more generic names for msg than data and cmd
make shm and sem unaware of ipc
make _t functions way more general
recheck that "set" functions behave the same way. shm does not attach to a segment, but other types do their unsafe functions. also ipc functions return weird types instead of accepting ipc pointers.
look up how to check for and catch memcpy errors.
make str_cat and msg_to_bin behave the same way
find a good place to put stray file documentation
make sure you commented scripts
make sure you commented test files
remove all the explicit references to uses in err documentation and convert them to @see
write styleguide
create example files
call scripts with make
start adding maximums
make sem member len customizable
